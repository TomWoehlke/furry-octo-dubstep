1A yoyos require a bind to return the yoyo
2A yoyos would be the more classic looping style of play

4A is offstring string not attached to axel
5A is called freehand and uses a counterweight

Cheaper and most common, also all yoyo types can be found in plastic

Wood
Are mostly 2A looping yoyos

Aluminum

You can buy yoyos from several different well known manufacturers based in different
countries: US, Canada, England, Germany, Italy, China, Japan are a few that come to mind

Most of the yoyos I own are YoYofactory

Good Plastic Starting YoYos
Loop 1080 (2A)
StarLite (1A 3A, or 5A)

I don't own any intermediate yoyos I moved from plastic beginner to advanced. The only
difference between advanced yoyos and intermediate yoyos are quality of parts and precision
in manufacture.
